# This is a template matrix class
I tried out the automatic documentation creation of doxygen, to check it [click here](https://github.com/Akosch242/Matrix/blob/main/devdoc.pdf), it is a bizarre combination of english and german while the autoformatting also being terrible.<br>
For a more condensed german description [click here](https://github.com/Akosch242/Matrix/blob/main/userdoc.pdf).<br>
<br>
If you can not understand either of those I recommend checking out the [main.ccp](https://github.com/Akosch242/Matrix/blob/main/main.cpp). I have written basic test cases here to showcase the exception handling and funcionality of the class.
